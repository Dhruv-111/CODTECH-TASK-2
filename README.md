# Overview of This Project

### Project: RED TEAM VS. BLUE TEAM SIMULATION

### Objective

The objective of this simulation is to create a dynamic environment where a Red Team, representing attackers, and a Blue Team, representing defenders, engage in a series of simulated cybersecurity exercises. The goal is to test and improve the security posture of a target network by simulating real-world attack scenarios and defenses.

### Key Activities

**Simulate Realistic Attack Scenarios:**

The Red Team will launch various types of attacks with different levels of sophistication on randomly selected devices within the target network.

**Monitor and Defend the Network:**

The Blue Team will continuously monitor the network for suspicious activities and respond to detected threats using appropriate defense strategies.

**Evaluate Defense Effectiveness:**

Track the effectiveness of the Blue Team's responses and measure their success in mitigating the attacks. A score will be maintained to quantify the performance of the Blue Team.

**Improve Security Posture:**

Use the outcomes of the simulation to identify weaknesses in the network's defenses and improve the overall security strategy.

### Details of the Simulation

**Network Configuration:**

The target network consists of devices such as a Server, Router, Firewall, Workstation, and Printer.

**Attack Execution:**

The Red Team will execute attacks such as Phishing, DDoS, Brute Force, and Malware Injection. Each attack will have a random sophistication level (Low, Medium, High).

**Defense Mechanism:**

The Blue Team will monitor the network continuously and respond to any detected threats. There is a 30% chance that the Blue Team's response may fail, allowing the Red Team to score.

**Scoring System:**

The Blue Team scores points for each successfully detected and mitigated attack. The score is displayed after each round to track performance.

**Simulation Rounds:**

The simulation will run for a predefined number of rounds (10 in this case), with each round consisting of an attack by the Red Team and a defense attempt by the Blue Team. The simulation includes a random pause between rounds to mimic real-world conditions.

**Expected Outcomes**

Blue Team: The Blue Team should aim to detect and respond to as many threats as possible, improving their score and demonstrating their ability to secure the network.
Red Team: The Red Team's objective is to successfully compromise devices within the network, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and testing the Blue Team's defenses.
Post-Simulation Analysis: After completing the simulation, analyze the results to identify trends in the types of attacks that were most successful and the defenses that were most effective. Use this information to enhance the network's security measures.

### Technologies Used

**Python Programming Language:** The entire program is written in Python, a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility.
